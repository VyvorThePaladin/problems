# Our company built an in-house calendar tool called HiCal. 
# You want to add a feature to see the times in a day when everyone is available.

# To do this, youâ€™ll need to know when any team is having a meeting. 
# In HiCal, a meeting is stored as a tuple of integers (start_time, end_time). 
# These integers represent the number of 30-minute blocks past 9:00am.

# Write a function merge_ranges() that takes a list of multiple meeting time ranges and 
# returns a list of condensed ranges.
# For example, given:
#   [(0, 1), (3, 5), (4, 8), (10, 12), (9, 10)]
# your function would return:
#   [(0, 1), (3, 8), (9, 12)]
